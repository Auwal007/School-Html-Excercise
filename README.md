This repository contains a collection of HTML excercises/projects I worked on over the past several months during my HTML programming 
course in school. These projects were originally developed for various assignments and learning exercises, but I’ve only now organized and pushed them to GitHub.

These minor projects cover various basic HTML concepts, which I explored as 
part of my coursework. You’ll find a variety of code examples that I wrote as a HTML newbie back then.

**Note**: These code were written some time ago in mid 2023 (between June and JUly), I now decided to share them here in a remote repo.
